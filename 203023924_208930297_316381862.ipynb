    "# Homework 1: Information Retrieval\n",
    "## Instructions\n",
    "1. Students will form teams of three people each and submit a single homework for each team in the format - ID1_ID2_ID3.ipynb\n",
    "2. Groups of three!\n",
    "2. **Do not write your names anywhere.**\n",
    "3. For the code part: \n",
    "> **Write your code only in the mentioned sections. Do not change the code of other sections**. Do not use any imports unless we say so.\n",
    "4. For theoretical questions, if any - write your answer in the markdown cell dedicated to this task, in **English**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deviation from the aforementioned  instructions will lead to reduced grade\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Clarifications\n",
    "1. The same score for the homework will be given to each member of the team.  \n",
    "2. The goal of this homework is to test your understanding of the concepts presented in the lectures. \\\n",
    "Anyhow, we provide here detailed explanations for the code part and if you have problems - ask.\n",
    "3. Questions can be sent to the forum, you are encouraged to ask questions but do so after you have been thinking about your question. \n",
    "4. The length of the empty gaps (where you are supposed to write your code) is a recommendation (the amount of space took us to write the solution) and writing longer code will not harm your grade. We do not expect you to use the programming tricks and hacks we used to make the code shorter.   \n",
    "Having said that, we do encourage you to write good code and keep that in mind - **extreme** cases may be downgraded.  \n",
    "We also encourage to use informative variable names - it is easier for us to check and for you to understand. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since it is the first time we provide this homework please notify us if there is a bug/something is unclear, typo's exc..\n",
    "\n",
    "5. We use Python 3.7 for programming.\n",
    "6. Make sure you have all the packages and functions used in the import section. Most of it is native to Anaconda Python distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Have fun !"

    "1. The computational complexity of the bag of words model is dependent on the number of documents in the corpus and the vocabulary size. Specifically, for each document, the model needs to iterate through each word in the document and update the counts and probabilities. Therefore, the complexity is O(N*M), where N is the number of documents and M is the average length of a document in terms of words.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To make this code better in terms of running time, we can consider parallelization techniques. For example, we can use multi-threading or multi-processing to distribute the work across multiple cores or machines. We can also use techniques such as MapReduce to divide the work into smaller chunks that can be processed in parallel. Additionally, we can consider using more efficient data structures and algorithms, such as sparse matrices and hash tables, to optimize memory usage and lookup times. Finally, we can also pre-process the data to remove stop words, perform stemming, and use other techniques to reduce the vocabulary size and improve the model's performance.\n",
